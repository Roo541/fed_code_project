# fed_code_project
3 coding projects for Fed San Francisco 

Files are in html format as write-ups were done in R markdown. Please click on file, then on the top right hand corner click "download raw file". Once downloaded you can click, open, and the html write-up will open on your web browser. The write-up contains the experiment, results, and the all of the code written (at the very bottom).

Thank you,
Roo
